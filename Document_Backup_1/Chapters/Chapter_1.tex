Since the theory Quantum Mechanics come up as a solution for the problem of the black body radiation \cite{Planck1901-rt, griffiths2018quantum}, no evidence has emerged to refute it, despite ongoing and rigorous testing of the theory \cite{Aspect-Experimental-Test,Bell-On-The,Mermin-Hidden-Variable}. The theory has only grew over the years, establishing a precise scale for measuring reality \cite{heisenberg1927uncertainty} and modifying the established protocols for studying microscopic systems \cite{bohr1928quantum, cohen1977quantum}.  Moreover, the theory has acquired an enigmatic quality both in the public sphere and within the physics community. This is due to the counterintuitive results of experiments, including those pertaining to wave-particle duality \cite{Wave-Particle}, the principle of superposition \cite{dirac1981principles-Superposition}, quantum entanglement \cite{Bell-Aspect-2004-Quantum-Entanglement}, and teleportation protocols \cite{Bennett1993-quantum-teleportation}, among numerous others. In 1925, Satyendra N. Bose and Albert Einstein made a significant theoretical prediction using the foundation of quantum mechanics. This was the Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) \cite{bose1924plancks-BOSE1,einstein1925quantentheorie-BOSE2}, which states that macroscopic number of particles  occupies a single particle states \cite{Quantum-Liquids}. This leads to the idea that a group of bosonic atoms at an ultra-low temperature can be seen as a ``super atom'' due to the overlap of all present wave functions.\\ \\

That only could be done with the techonological advances, that lead to achieve the experiemnt in. One of the important acaractheristic fo the system is the superfluidity, here it represent a macroscopic characterist of the aunqum mechanics world.
